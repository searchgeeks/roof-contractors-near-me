    <p>We bought a house with the old and leaking roof. We did reach out to different companies and Proven gave a reasonable price to do the replacement.  The owner Ryan was extremely knowledgeable and patiently explain the process. The job took a bit longer than expected but it went really well and the team of workers was really respectful and did a good job overall! Would highly recommend and always make Proven my first call for anything roof related.</p>

    <p>I had my roof, siding, and gutters all replaced and couldn’t have asked for anything better! Everyone I spoke to at proven contracting was helpful, responsible, and trustworthy. Starting from the estimate I was given, to the teardown and the construction of the roof and siding, the service provided was great. I was informed and updated about the progress and the result was fabulous.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend Proven! They did an excellent job installing my new roof, skylight, and gutters. The entire process was seamless. Ryan, the owner, provided a lot of guidance on selecting the shingles and planning the project. Tito, the project manager, and his installation team were very professional, experienced, thorough, and made sure everything was done perfectly. I give Proven 5 stars!</p>

    <p>We decided to work with Proven Contracting to replace our roof after getting our estimate from Dave and talking to project manager Emanuel. Their price was very reasonable and they did not waste our time and got straight to the point.  We are so happy and satisfied with the work they did and their professionalism. Emanuel and the whole crew were great and we are thrilled how our roof came out. We were very impressed how the crew work together and finished the job on time and the clean up was immaculate. I can’t say enough about the clean up after the job was finished. It was pleasure working with them and I would recommend them to my friends and family. Thank you Emanuel for going above and beyond.</p>
